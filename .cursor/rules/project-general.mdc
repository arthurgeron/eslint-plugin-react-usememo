# Project General Guidelines

## Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to provide an ESLint plugin that helps developers optimize React applications by enforcing the use of `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders and improve performance.

## General Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the ESLint plugin, including the rule implementations and utility functions.
- `docs/`: Contains documentation for the plugin and its rules.
- `examples/`: Contains example React projects demonstrating the use of the plugin with different ESLint configurations.
- `__tests__/`: Contains test cases for the plugin rules.
- `src/utils/compatibility.ts`: Provides compatibility utilities for ESLint v8 and v9.

## Key Dependencies

- `yarn`: Package manager
- `eslint`: The core ESLint library. Both V8 and V9 (eslint-v9).
- `react`: The React library (used in examples and tests).

## ESLint Version Support

The project is designed to work with both ESLint v8 and v9. The `src/utils/compatibility.ts` file provides utilities to handle differences between the two versions.

## Configuration Files

- ESLint v8: `.eslintrc.json`
- ESLint v9: `eslint.config.js`

## Documentation
