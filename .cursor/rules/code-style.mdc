# Code Style Guidelines

## TypeScript

The project uses TypeScript.

## React Best Practices

Follow React best practices for component design, state management, and performance optimization.

## Memoization

Use `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `React.memo` appropriately to optimize performance.

## Error Handling

Implement robust error handling and validation.

## Performance Considerations

- Avoid RegExp where simple string operations suffice
- Consider the real-time nature of ESLint plugins in IDEs
- Optimize for frequent calls and minimal overhead
- Profile critical paths before making optimizations
- Prefer simple, direct implementations over complex ones
- Be especially careful with operations that run on every file parse
