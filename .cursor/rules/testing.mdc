# Testing Guidelines

## Testing Approach

The project uses Jest for testing.

## Test Case Structure

Test cases are located in the `__tests__` directory and are separated into `validTestCases` and `invalidTestCases` to cover both passing and failing scenarios.

## Version Compatibility Testing

The same test cases are executed against both ESLint v8 and ESLint v9 to ensure compatibility. This is achieved by extracting shared test cases into the `__tests__/testcases` directory and utilizing the appropriate ESLint runner in:
- `__tests__/eslint-v8/rules.test.ts` for ESLint v8
- `__tests__/eslint-v9/rules.test.ts` for ESLint v9

## Test Execution

Tests are executed using the command `yarn test`.

## Test Case Utility

The test cases are generated by a set of utility functions located in the `__tests__/testcases` directory:
- `createRequireMemoTestCases` from `__tests__/testcases/requireMemo.ts`
- `createRequireUseCallbackTestCases` from `__tests__/testcases/requireUseCallback.ts`
- `createRequireUseMemoTestCases` from `__tests__/testcases/requireUseMemo.ts`
- `createRequireUseMemoChildrenTestCases` from `__tests__/testcases/requireUseMemoChildren.ts`

## Example Test Execution

```bash
yarn test
```
