# ESLint Guidelines

## What is ESLint?

ESLint is a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.

## Purpose

To enforce code style, catch potential errors, and improve code quality.

## Configuration

This project supports both ESLint v8 (traditional configuration using `.eslintrc.json`) and ESLint v9 (flat configuration using `eslint.config.js`).

## Plugin

This project provides an ESLint plugin named `@arthurgeron/eslint-plugin-react-usememo`.

## Rules

The plugin includes the following rules:

- `require-usememo`: Requires complex values passed as props or used as hook dependencies to be wrapped in `useMemo` or `useCallback`.
- `require-memo`: Requires all function components to be wrapped in `React.memo()`.
- `require-usememo-children`: Requires complex values passed as children to be wrapped in `useMemo` or `useCallback`.

## Compatibility

The plugin is designed to be compatible with both ESLint v8 and v9, using utility functions in `src/utils/compatibility.ts` to handle differences between the versions.


## Documentation
